## 🟩 Grass Top Fix (v5.3)

### 🔁 Changed
- Updated the grass cube-net so the top face is green again.
- Bottom face now matches dirt for better consistency.

### ✅ Fixes
- Grass blocks no longer show dirt on top.

### 🧪 Technical Impact
- No layout changes; still 48x32 cube-net per block.
- Fully compatible with the existing runtime atlas build.
